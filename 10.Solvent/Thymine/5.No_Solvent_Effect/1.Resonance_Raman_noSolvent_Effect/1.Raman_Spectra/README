Here you will find all of the states, each of them
has the following calculations:

	1. ABS Spectra
	2. Raman Spectra

It is important to plot FIRST the 'ABS Spectra' and 
from its information, the 'Raman Spectra'.

Here are the specific calcilations per state, but 
there's also another folder with specific ABS Spectra
data, where the 'spec_Int_TD.dat'(where x= energy and
y = ABS intensity) is used in order to plot the sum of
all the "y's". This means that all the "ABS intensities"
per each state are going to be sum, and from this a plot
is made.

NOTE:
Bright States: 2nd, 5th and 6th
