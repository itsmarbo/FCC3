			Excited States
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Having obtained the complete TDDFT calculation, all the .log 
nucleotides are analized and it is found that they have different
Excited States, some of them are luminous and others not.

For these calculations, only the bright states are considered (root=x)
this indicates where the electron could be most probable to move.
