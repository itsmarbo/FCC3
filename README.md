 Study of nucleotides and their properties
In this study the nucleotides: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine and Uracil are evaluated. The main characteristic to study is the excited states for each nucleotide. The objective is to generate the spectrum per molecule and to compare it with the experimental data. All calculations were performed by using Gaussian 16 and FCclasses3 using CAM-B3LYP and 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set.
