		Distortion
-------------------------------------------------------
In this folder there are the files containing thymine but
with a slight difference, which is a distortion from one
of the hydrogens.

Important Remarks:
1. When we have an out of plane structure then the phenomena occuring is the coupling between BRIGHT and DARK states.

2. When looking for a Transition Dipole (TD) in the output the polarization in TD do not have a,y or z defined.
